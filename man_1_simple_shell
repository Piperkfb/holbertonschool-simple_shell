.SH Name
Simple Shell 

.SYNOPSIS
./hsh

.SH DESCRIPTION
We have written a UNIX command line interpreter. It reads lines from the terminal, interprets them, and executes. The command will display a prompt and wait for the user to type a command. The command line will end with a new line. It will handle errors and the end of file condition. It will handle the PATH and fork() will be called if the command doesn't exist. We have implemented the built-ins; env and exit.
